Career Domain Recommendation System
Project Overview
       This project is designed to assist students in identifying suitable career domains based on their interests, skills, and preferences. It uses a cosine similarity algorithm to analyze responses from a questionnaire and determine the closest matching career field. The system operates as a Flask web application with a structured database storing predefined career domains and their attributes.

Key Features
      Questionnaire-Based Career Assessment: Users answer 10–15 questions related to their skills, interests, and problem-solving approaches.
      Cosine Similarity Algorithm for Matching: The algorithm calculates similarity between the user's responses and predefined career profiles to determine the best-suited domain.
      Custom Career Dataset: Since data availability is limited, a manually curated dataset is used, covering various career fields with their required skills and knowledge areas.
      Web-Based Interface: A simple and interactive UI built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy user access.
      Personalized Career Suggestions: Provides recommendations across multiple career paths, including technology, science, arts, business, and more.
Technology Stack
      Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
      Backend: Python (Flask)
      Machine Learning Algorithm: Cosine Similarity
      Database: MongoDB (or SQLite for lightweight use)
      Career Domain Dataset (Example)
      
To enhance recommendations, I’ve created a sample dataset with various career domains and associated skills:

Career Domain	Skills Required	Example Roles
Data Science	Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Statistics	Data Scientist, AI Engineer
Web Development	HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, React	Frontend Developer, Full Stack Dev
Cybersecurity	Networking, Ethical Hacking, Cryptography	Security Analyst, Pentester
Software Engineering	Java, C++, Software Architecture, Problem-Solving	Software Developer, SDE
Marketing & SEO	Digital Marketing, SEO, Content Writing	SEO Specialist, Marketing Analyst
Finance & Investment	Economics, Stock Market, Financial Analysis	Investment Banker, Financial Analyst
Graphic Design	Adobe Photoshop, UI/UX, Creativity	Graphic Designer, UI Designer
This dataset can be expanded further based on analysis and user feedback.

Outcome
The system provides data-driven career recommendations by analyzing user responses against a predefined dataset. It helps students explore career paths aligned with their interests, ensuring informed decision-making and career satisfaction.
